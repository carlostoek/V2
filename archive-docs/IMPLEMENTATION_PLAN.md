# Diana Bot V2 - Phase 3 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for completing Phase 3 of the Diana Bot V2 refactorization project. The plan focuses on refining the core systems, completing the integration between modules, and implementing advanced features as outlined in the project requirements.

## Current Status (Phase 3 in Progress)

As of July 31, 2025, the project has:
- Completed Phases 1 (Implementation of Flujo Transversal) and 2 (Implementation of Handlers and UI)
- Implemented core systems: Event Bus, Narrative Service, Gamification Service, User Service
- Started work on the Bot Orchestrator (Facade) implementation
- Set up the testing environment with fixtures
- Started implementing the Admin module

## Priority Areas for Completion

### 1. Core Architecture Refactoring (High Priority)

#### 1.1 Dependency Injection Container Migration
- **Objective**: Migrate from the simple DI container to the recommended `dependency-injector` library
- **Tasks**:
  - Create new container classes following the library's pattern
  - Register all services properly with their dependencies
  - Implement container configuration loading from config files
  - Update bootstrap process to use the new container

#### 1.2 Bot Orchestrator (Facade) Enhancement
- **Objective**: Complete the implementation of the Orchestrator as the central coordination point
- **Tasks**:
  - Expand the Orchestrator to handle all types of user interactions
  - Implement comprehensive state management via the Orchestrator
  - Integrate the Diana AI response generation logic in the Orchestrator
  - Connect all handlers to use the Orchestrator as their primary interface

#### 1.3 Configuration Management Centralization
- **Objective**: Refactor configuration management to use a central system
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a CentralConfig singleton following the pattern in CLAUDE.md
  - Migrate all hardcoded configuration values to the central system
  - Set up environment-based configuration loading
  - Create config schema validation

### 2. Admin Module Completion (High Priority)

#### 2.1 Admin Service Enhancement
- **Objective**: Complete the Admin Service implementation
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement subscription management functionality
  - Develop channel management features
  - Add user statistics collection and reporting
  - Implement token management for VIP access

#### 2.2 Admin UI Development
- **Objective**: Complete the admin user interface
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement tariff management keyboards and handlers
  - Create channel management UI
  - Build statistics dashboard
  - Develop token generation and management UI

### 3. Integration and Testing (High Priority)

#### 3.1 Event-Driven Integration
- **Objective**: Ensure all modules communicate effectively through the event bus
- **Tasks**:
  - Define comprehensive event catalog
  - Implement event listeners in all services
  - Create integration tests for complex event chains
  - Document event flow and dependencies

#### 3.2 Testing Strategy Implementation
- **Objective**: Achieve >90% test coverage across all modules
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement unit tests for all services and handlers
  - Create integration tests for all critical flows
  - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  - Develop mocks for external dependencies

### 4. New Features Implementation (Medium Priority)

#### 4.1 Shop System
- **Objective**: Implement the "besitos" shop system
- **Tasks**:
  - Design database schema for shop items
  - Implement shop service with item management
  - Create shop UI and handlers
  - Integrate with the points system

#### 4.2 Trivia System
- **Objective**: Implement the trivia and responses system
- **Tasks**:
  - Design trivia data model
  - Implement trivia service
  - Create trivia UI and handlers
  - Integrate with narrative and gamification

#### 4.3 VIP Token System
- **Objective**: Implement the VIP token system
- **Tasks**:
  - Design token generation and validation system
  - Implement token redemption logic
  - Create UI for token management
  - Integrate with the admin module

#### 4.4 Emotional System Refinement
- **Objective**: Enhance the emotional response system
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement state machine for emotional transitions
  - Create emotional middleware for all interactions
  - Develop contextual response generation
  - Integrate with the narrative system
